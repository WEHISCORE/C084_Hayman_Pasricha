<h1 id="setting-up-the-data">Setting up the data</h1>
<p>We start from the count matrices created in <a href="../code/scPipe.R%60"><code>code/scPipe.R</code></a>, specifically the <a href="../data/SCEs/C084_Hayman_Pasricha.UMI_deduped.scPipe.SCE.rds">UMI counts (a.k.a. UMI-deduplicated) data</a> and <a href="../data/SCEs/C084_Hayman_Pasricha.not_UMI_deduped.scPipe.SCE.rds">read counts (a.k.a. not UMI-deduplicated) data</a>.</p>
<aside>
UMI stands for unique molecular identifier.
</aside>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>We combine these into a single object<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> containing both the UMI counts and the read counts for 32857 genes and 588 samples.</p>
<h2 id="incorporating-gene-based-annotation">Incorporating gene-based annotation</h2>
<p>We obtain gene-based annotations from the NCBI/RefSeq and Ensembl databases, such as the chromosome and gene symbol, using the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/Homo.sapiens">Homo.sapiens</a></em> and <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86">EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86</a></em> packages.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>Having quantified gene expression against the GENCODE gene annotation, we have Ensembl-style identifiers for the genes. These identifiers are used as they are unambiguous and highly stable. However, they are difficult to interpret compared to the gene symbols which are more commonly used in the literature. Henceforth, we will use gene symbols (where available) to refer to genes in our analysis and otherwise use the Ensembl-style gene identifiers<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Cell-based annotations are included in the <em>colData</em> of the <em>SingleCellExperiment</em>. In particular, we include all the sample metadata provided by Tom in the <a href="../data/sample_sheets/ZIPT%20metadata.xlsx"><code>data/sample_sheets/ZIPT metadata.xlsx</code></a> spreadsheet by matching samples on the <code>ID</code> column.</p>

<h1 id="failure-of-lce475">Failure of <code>LCE475</code></h1>
<p>There are 3 batches of samples in total - LCE475, C084_LC475_mini_bulk_back_up_1:10, and LCE_476_BU_8_cycle - and these are technical replicates of one another (i.e. each well contains the same sample across all 3 batches).</p>
<p>It was not the original plan to have each sample in triplicate across batches. The <code>LCE475</code> batch was intended to be the only batch, but something went wrong in the library preparation and it generated very few reads (maximum library size in reads = 1960). According to Daniel Brown, likely what happened is that there was carry-over of a large number of molecules without adapters, which meant that the <code>LCE475</code> library contained few sequence-able molecules. We therefore remove the <code>LCE475</code> batch from further analysis.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>Following the failure of <code>LCE475</code>, the library preparation was repeated several times, documented in the table below<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<h1 id="have-we-sequenced-enough">Have we sequenced enough?</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>SCORE’s mini-bulk protocol is still being finalised and some technical questions remain. In particular, we want to know if we have sequenced enough to answer the biological questions of interest.</p>
<p>One way of estimating if we have sequenced enough uses a metric called ‘sequencing saturation’. 10x Genomics have some useful information about sequencing saturation available <a href="https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062366-What-is-sequencing-saturation-">here</a>. In particular,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sequencing saturation is a measure of the fraction of library complexity that was sequenced in a given experiment. The inverse of the sequencing saturation can be interpreted as the number of additional reads it would take to detect a new transcript. … Sequencing saturation is dependent on the library complexity and sequencing depth. Different cell types will have different amounts of RNA and thus will differ in the total number of different transcripts in the final library (also known as library complexity). … As sequencing depth increases, more genes are detected, but this reaches saturation at different sequencing depths depending on cell type. … Sequencing depth also affects sequencing saturation; generally, the more sequencing reads, the more additional unique transcripts you can detect. However, this is limited by the library complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This naturally leads to the question of <a href="https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002474263-How-much-sequencing-saturation-should-I-aim-for-">‘how much sequencing saturation should I aim for?’</a>, which very much depends on the goals of the experiment. For this experiment, where we wish to assess differential expression between treatment arms, we will likely want quite high sequencing saturation.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>To begin, we simply examine the number of reads sequenced/sample.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>These results show that the libraries are massively enriched for sequences from hemoglobin subunit genes and we have consequently over-sequenced these genes and likely under-sequenced the rest of the transcriptome. Further sequencing of these samples may therefore be necessary.</p>
<aside>
We would likely pick just one of <code>LC475</code> and <code>LC476</code> for further sequencing.
</aside>
<p>One way to think of sequencing saturation is <a href="https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002474263-How-much-sequencing-saturation-should-I-aim-for-">provided by 10x Genomics</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inverse of the sequencing saturation can be interpreted as roughly the number of new transcripts you expect to find with one new read. If sequencing saturation is at 50%, it means that every 2 new reads will result in 1 new UMI count (unique transcript) detected. In contrast, 90% sequencing saturation means that 10 new reads are necessary to obtain one new UMI count. If the sequencing saturation is high, additional sequencing would not recover much new information for the library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, remember that in doing further sequencing we will still be ‘paying the price’ of further sequencing the hemoglobin subunit genes, i.e. the new transcripts we identify are likely to include a large proportion of additional hemoglobin subunit transcripts.</p>
<p>An alternative to simply re-sequencing the existing library may be to first perform a technique like ‘DASH’, which uses “recombinant Cas9 protein complexed with a library of guide RNAs targeting unwanted species for cleavage, thus preventing them from consuming sequencing space” <span class="citation" data-cites="gu2016depletion">(Gu et al. <a href="#ref-gu2016depletion" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. The feasibility/suitability of using such a technique for this project would require further discussion with SCORE.</p>
<h1 id="umi-counts-vs.-read-counts">UMI counts vs. read counts</h1>
<h2 id="motivation-1">Motivation</h2>
<p>A unique feature of SCORE’s ‘mini-bulk’ RNA-sequencing protocol is the incorporation of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) into the library preparation; an ordinary bulk RNA-seq protocol does not incorporate UMIs.</p>
<p>UMIs are commonly used in single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, such as the CEL-Seq2 protocol from which the mini-bulk protocol is adapted. UMIs are molecular tags that are used to detect and quantify unique mRNA transcripts. In this method, mRNA libraries are generated by fragmentation and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. Oligo(dT) primers with specific sequencing linkers are added to the cDNA. Another sequencing linker with a 6 bp random label and an index sequence is added to the 5’ end of the template, which is amplified and sequenced.</p>
<aside>
This explanation is adapted from <a href="https://sapac.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/umi.html">https://sapac.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/umi.html</a>.
</aside>
<p>The UMI count is always less than or equal to the read count and a UMI count of zero also implies a read count of zero.</p>
<p>Pros of using UMIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can sequence unique mRNA transcripts</li>
<li>Can detect transcripts occurring at low frequencies</li>
<li>Transcripts can be quantified based on sequencing reads specific to each barcode</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons of using UMIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCORE’s mini-bulk protocol uses a <span class="math inline">\(k=6\)</span> bp UMI<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and so (theoretically) the maximum UMI count for each gene is <span class="math inline">\(4^6 = 4096\)</span>.</li>
<li>There is therefore a risk that highly expressed genes may have their expression measurements artificially truncated, particularly if the sample is deeply sequenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>To investigate whether expression measurements are being ‘truncated’ in this dataset, and decide whether to use the UMI counts or the read counts, we generated and now analyse two count matrices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>UMI counts (i.e. deduplicating UMI counts)</li>
<li>Read counts (i.e. not deduplicating UMI counts, equivalent to ignoring the UMIs)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:read-distribution">4</a> plots the distribution of the logarithm of the read counts. From this we see that the vast majority of read counts are small. In fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>66.1% of read counts are 0</li>
<li>95% of the read counts are no greater than 41</li>
<li>99% of the read counts are no greater than 179</li>
<li>99.9% of the read counts are no greater than 1074</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, only (0.018%) of read counts exceed the <span class="math inline">\(4^6 = 4096\)</span> threshold.</p>
<aside>
Surprisingly, 0.004% of UMI counts exceed the theoretical maximum of <span class="math inline">\(4^6=4096\)</span>. At this stage it is not clear to me how this can occur.

<li>The 3 worst offenders are all hemoglobin subunits</li>

<p>We can investigate this list more formally using a statistical test for over-representation of gene ontology (GO) terms in this gene set. This is done using the <code>goana()</code> function from the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/limma">limma</a></em> package. These results are shown in the table below. Several of the top GO terms relate to haptoglobin and hemoglobin, mitochondrial functions, and immune terms. However, it is somewhat concerning to see ‘response to stress’ at the top of this list, which may indicate the sample quality was compromised prior to or during library preparation.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:scatterplot-and-ma-plot">5</a> plots the relationship between UMI counts and read counts for all genes and samples. There are a few notable points about this figure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The UMI counts and read counts are very strongly associated.</li>
<li>The log-fold change between the read counts and the UMI counts can be large, indicating the UMI counts are likely removing substantial PCR amplification noise.</li>
<li>The log-fold changes between the read counts and the UMI counts are larger on average for more highly expressed genes. The variation in the log-fold change is larger for the lowly expressed genes.</li>
<li>The hemoglobin genes stand out. These genes are extremely highly expressed, meaning that they likely saturate the 6 bp UMIs and which leads to the strange relationship between the UMI counts and the read counts for these genes.</li>

<p>Rather than looking at all samples and all genes at once, can also examine the relationship between UMI counts and read counts within a single sample across genes (Figure <a href="#fig:within-sample-cors">6</a>) and within a single gene across samples (Figure <a href="#fig:within-gene-cors">7</a>).</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>These figures show that the UMI counts and read counts are highly correlated across both samples (median = 0.990, median absolute deviation = 0.004) and genes (median = 0.966, median absolute deviation = 0.030).</p>
<aside>
The genes with the lowest correlations are the aforementioned highly-expressed hemoglobin subunits.

<h2 id="summary-1">Summary</h2>
<p>As there are so few genes with read counts that exceed the threshold of <span class="math inline">\(4^6 = 4096\)</span> there is little risk that the expression measurements are artificially truncated by using the UMI counts. Additionally, compared to the read counts, the UMI counts have the advantage that they mitigate the effects of PCR amplification noise. We therefore opt to use the UMI counts in all the analysis the follows.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-quality-control-metrics">Defining the quality control metrics</h2>
<p>Low-quality samples need to be removed to ensure that technical effects do not distort downstream analysis results. We use several quality control (QC) metrics to measure the quality of the samples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sum</code>: This measures the library size of the samples, which is the total sum of counts across genes. We want samples to have high library sizes as this means more RNA has been successfully captured during library preparation.</li>
<li><code>detected</code>: This is the number of expressed features<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> in each sample. Samples with few expressed features are likely to be of poor quality, as the diverse transcript population has not been successful captured.</li>
<li><code>subsets_Mt_percent</code>: This measures the proportion of reads which are mapped to mitochondrial RNA. If there is a higher than expected proportion of mitochondrial RNA this is often symptomatic of a sample which is under stress and is therefore of low quality and will not be used for the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>For mini-bulk data, we typically observe library sizes that are in the hundreds of thousands<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and several thousand expressed genes per cell.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>The aim is to remove putative low-quality samples that have low library sizes, low numbers of expressed features, and high mitochondrial proportions. Such samples can interfere with downstream analyses, e.g., by forming distinct clusters that complicate interpretation of the results.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-the-qc-metrics">Visualizing the QC metrics</h2>
<p>The distributions of these metrics are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:qcplot">8</a>, stratified by plate.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is also valuable to examine how the QC metrics behave with respect to each other (Figure <a href="#fig:qcbiplot">9</a>). Generally, they will be in rough agreement, i.e., samples with low total counts will also have low numbers of expressed features and high mitochondrial proportions. Clear discrepancies may correspond to technical differences between batches of samples or genuine biological differences in RNA content.</p>

<p>The results in Figures <a href="#fig:qcplot">8</a> and <a href="#fig:qcbiplot">9</a> show that more genes are detected on average for samples on plate <code>LC476</code> (median = 12,047) compared to plate <code>LC475</code> (median = 10,664). Furthermore, this required slightly fewer UMIs/sample on average for samples on plate <code>LC476</code> (median = 160,358) compared to plate <code>LC475</code> (median = 162,206). The samples on plate <code>LC476</code> do have on average a slightly higher percentage of counts from mitochondrial transcripts (median = 4.93%) compared to plate <code>LC475</code> (median = 1.78%), but both are small in absolute terms.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-outliers-by-each-metric">Identifying outliers by each metric</h2>
<p>Outliers are defined based on the median absolute deviation (MADs) from the median value of each metric across all samples. We remove small outliers for the library size and the number of expressed features. Removal of low-quality samples is then performed by combining the filters for all of the metrics.</p>
<p>Due to the differences in the QC metrics by plate, we will compute our outlier thresholds at the plate-level.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-out-low-abundance-genes">Filtering out low-abundance genes</h2>
<p>Low-abundance genes are problematic as zero or near-zero counts do not contain much information for reliable statistical inference <span class="citation" data-cites="bourgon2010independent">(Bourgon, Gentleman, and Huber <a href="#ref-bourgon2010independent" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. These genes typically do not provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis during testing, yet they still increase the severity of the multiple testing correction. In addition, the discreteness of the counts may interfere with statistical procedures, e.g., by compromising the accuracy of continuous approximations. Thus, low-abundance genes are often removed in many RNA-seq analysis pipelines before the application of downstream methods.</p>
<p>The ‘optimal’ choice of filtering strategy depends on the downstream application. A more aggressive filter is usually required to remove discreteness (e.g., for normalization) compared to that required for removing underpowered tests. For hypothesis testing, the filter statistic should also be independent of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Thus, we (or the relevant function) will filter at each step as needed, rather than applying a single filter for the entire analysis.</p>
<p>Several metrics can be used to define low-abundance genes. The most obvious is the average count for each gene, computed across all cells in the data set. We typically observe a peak of moderately expressed genes following a plateau of lowly expressed genes (Figure <a href="#fig:abhist">13</a>).</p>

                   UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in
                   Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a
                   practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world
                   data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for
                   visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the
                   global structure with superior run time performance.
                   Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on
                   embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose
