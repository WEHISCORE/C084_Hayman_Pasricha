# Overview

In this analysis, **TODO** Write overview.

After sequencing, expression was quantified by counting the number of UMIs mapped to each gene using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scPipe")`[@tian2018scpipe].
Count data for all endogeneous genes (GENCODE Release 28 (GRCh38.p12)) and spike-in transcripts (ERCC) are available in this repository.

This analysis is adapted from the [**Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor** book](https://osca.bioconductor.org) and the [**RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR** workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/RNAseq123/) [@law2016rna].

# Analysis version information  {.appendix}
